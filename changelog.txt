v1.0.5 -
Additions:
* Added Challenge completion tracking to the mod challenges menu
* Added localization code support
* Added settings to change unifont rendering size
* Add Update callbacks for GridEntityTNT
* Add Render callbacks for GridEntityLock and GridEntityTeleporter
* LayerState:
	- Get/SetWrapSMode
	- Get/SetWrapTMode
	- these play some currently unknown role in allowing sprites to wrap around, and is required for Beam sprites
* Beam and Point have recieved some reworks in preparation for a future cord reimplementation
	- The Sprite used in the Beam must be in the same "scope" as the Beam. For example, a global Sprite and local Beam works, but local Sprite` and global Beam won't. They can also both be global/local or in the same table.
	- Point no longer has a Color object for the time being to save some space. It should hopefully return later, pending finding a good way to optimize it.

* ModsMenu.GetSelectedElement() and ModsMenu.SetSelectedElement() now start at 1 to be more intuitive
* ModsMenu.SetSelectedElement() clamps values below and above the amount of mods the player has
